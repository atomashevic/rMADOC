    dataset from Zenodo. This package provides functions to download and analyze data from different 
    platforms (Reddit, Voat, Bluesky, Koo) and communities, making it easy to study cross-platform 
    content and community dynamics. Features include progress tracking, automatic file size verification,
    and support for both individual platform downloads and community pairs.
